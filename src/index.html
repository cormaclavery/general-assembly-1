          About me

      <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
        <p>I am a 25 year old professional in tech support for FEXCO MS a financial services company in the south-west of Ireland. I initially became interested in programming during the two years of computer science I took as part of my bachelors in psychology where I learned JAVA, MYSQL, VB, and UNIX command line to display data models, computer science concepts and create psychological evaluation applications.</p>

        <p>After university I followed my creative passions by working as a chef where I grew up after deciding that a career in psychology was not for me. although the work was stimulating I rediscovered my interest in programming/development after doing the HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT courses on codecademy; I applied for IT jobs and was offered a job shortly as a technical support representative for FEXCO MS servicing it's estate of POS devices. I was then quickly promoted to terminal support engineer due to my quick grasp of the material, critical thinking skills and familiarity with IT, I have since then garnered many additional responsibilities but the ones most pertinent to my IT skills would be: production releases of QA'd material, managing software roll-outs, Advanced SQL selects on the POS device estate database and POS device software configuration database.</p>

        <p>The next step of progression at my current work would be to go into POS device software development using C and the bespoke VERIFONE Os/Eos however I believe that this technology is not the future of point of sale solutions with pressure from ApplePay, Stripe, Google Wallet and other mobile/web based solutions which do not rely on a single hardware supplier and a single purpose device. With Android as the most numerous mobile OS on the market and my previous experience with JAVA I decided to seek out an avenue to better realise my ambition to be a developer. General assembly has a great reputation globally from the research I completed and the intensive android development course seems like a good fit for my current skill-set while also offering me the opportunity to learn a large amount of material from experts in the field</p>

        <p>As I am already familiar with HTML, CSS and JS from previous online tutorials I decided I would make use of some additional development tools/frameworks that I researched during the course of this project. This site was built using the MD lite framework which adds the material design style to the web. MD lite was applied to the buttons and to the cards but I did not make too much use of it as I wanted to match the style of the example site built on the dash course provided. I also installed some development tools using NPM and implemented in a GULP file. Through GULP I applied the following utilities: browser-sync (for testing on the fly design changes), sass (to allow nesting of css style components and implementation of variables in css i.e. scss), minify (to make the converted css in the build neater), and auto-prefixer (to automatically apply other browser kits to allow cross compatibility)</p>

        <p>All changes have been recorded in GITHUB and a link to the GIT has been provided in the navbar above and will open in a new tab when selected. I used SourceTree to manage all commits.</p>

        <p>I hope this project shows my ambition to exceed expectations, to learn new tools quickly and to use them effectively. I look forward to speaking with you and would be glad to answer any questions about myself, this website and my thought processes during the Skype interview.</p>
