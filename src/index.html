          About me
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
        <p>I am a 25 year old professional in tech support for <a href="https://fexco.com/merchant-services/introduction/">FEXCO MS</a> a financial services company in the south-west of Ireland. I initially became interested in programming during the two years of computer science I took as part of my bachelors in psychology where I learned <strong>JAVA, MYSQL, VB,</strong> and <strong>UNIX</strong> command line to display data models, computer science concepts and create psychological evaluation applications.</p>

        <p>After university I followed my creative passions by working as a chef where I grew up after deciding that a career in psychology was not for me. although the work was stimulating I rediscovered my interest in programming/development after doing the <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong> courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">codecademy</a>; I applied for IT jobs and was offered a job shortly as a technical support representative for FEXCO MS servicing it's estate of POS devices. I was then quickly promoted to terminal support engineer due to my quick grasp of the material, critical thinking skills and familiarity with IT, I have since then garnered many additional responsibilities but the ones most pertinent to my IT skills would be: 
        <ul>
        <li>production releases of QA'd material</li>
        <li>managing software roll-outs</li>
        <li>Advanced SQL selects on the POS device estate database</li>
        <li>POS device software configuration database</li></ul></p>

        <p>The next step of progression at my current work would be to go into POS device software development using C and the bespoke VERIFONE Os/Eos however I believe that this technology is not the future of point of sale solutions with pressure from <strong>ApplePay, Stripe, Google Wallet</strong> and other mobile/web based solutions which do not rely on a single hardware supplier and a single purpose device. With <strong>Android</strong> as the most numerous mobile OS on the market and my previous experience with <strong>JAVA</strong> I decided to seek out an avenue to better realise my ambition to be a developer. <strong>General assembly</strong> has a great reputation globally from the research I completed and the <strong>intensive android development</strong> course seems like a good fit for my current skill-set while also offering me the opportunity to learn a large amount of material from experts in the field</p>

        <p>As I am already familiar with <strong>HTML, CSS </strong>and <strong>JS</strong> from previous online tutorials I decided I would make use of some additional development tools/frameworks that I researched during the course of this project. This site was built using the <strong>MD lite framework</strong> which adds the <strong>material design</strong> style to the web. <strong>MD lite</strong> was applied to the buttons and to the cards but I did not make too much use of it as I wanted to match the style of the example site built on the dash course provided. I also installed some development tools using <strong>NPM</strong> and implemented in a <strong>GULP</strong> file. Through <strong>GULP</strong> </p>

        <p>I applied the following utilities: 
        <ul>
        <li><strong>browser-sync</strong> for testing on the fly design changes</li>
        <li><strong>sass</strong> to allow nesting of css style components and implementation of variables in css i.e. scss</li>
        <li><strong>minify</strong> to make the converted css in the build neater/smaller file size</li>
        <li><strong>auto-prefixer</strong> to automatically apply other browser kits to allow cross/back compatibility</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>All changes have been recorded in <strong>GITHUB</strong> and a link to the <strong>GIT</strong> has been provided in the navbar above and will open in a new tab when selected. I used <strong>SourceTree</strong> to manage all commits.</p>

        <p>I hope this project shows my ambition to <strong>exceed expectations</strong>, to <strong>learn new tools quickly</strong> and to use them effectively. I look forward to speaking with you and would be glad to answer any questions about myself, this website and my thought processes during the Skype interview.</p>
